        <Text>
          Think of Reboot (who are supporting the event) but with a focus on
          games and gamification. It's a super fun event where we come together
          to brainstorm, design, and develop a game or gamified app from scratch
          - all within a limited time frame.

          Whether you're a coding wizard, design guru, or just someone with a
          wild imagination and an interest in games, there's a place for you in
          this adventure. 60 attendees will word to solve challenges using games
          or gamification techniques over a 2-day period at the V&A museum in
          Dundee.

          This is a fantastic way to unleash creativity and explore new
          possibilities in game design by bringing together developers,
          designers, and other creatives to rapidly prototype and experiment
          with new ideas, mechanics, and art styles.

          On Tuesday 4th March, we will host inspiring Tech Talks, Workshops and
          Exhibits! With carefully curated content focusing on game development,
          design, and engineering, we know it will be a valuable opportunity for
          you to learn more and meet people from across disciplines of LBG and
          external collaborations such as the Founder of Scottish Games Network,
          Product Director from Opera, Abertay & Dundee University Games
          Departments and much more!
